# Job Cost Report Automation

## Overview
This project was developed during my internship to improve the efficiency and accuracy of job cost reporting processes. The goal was to automate reporting templates, streamline workflows, and enhance budget forecasting and financial reporting capabilities.

## Features
- **Automation**: Utilized advanced VBA scripting ![VBA Script Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/VBScript_Logo.png) and Excel ![Excel Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013-2019_logo.svg) functions to automate job cost reporting templates.
- **Data Integration**: Consolidated multiple data sources to ensure seamless cost tracking and accurate financial reporting.
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Streamlined workflows, enhancing efficiency in budget forecasting and reporting processes.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** ![Excel Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013-2019_logo.svg): Leveraged advanced functions, pivot tables, and macros for reporting and analysis.
- **VBA Script** ![VBA Script Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/VBScript_Logo.png): Automated repetitive tasks, reducing manual workload and minimizing errors.
- **Data Analysis**: Applied data manipulation techniques to ensure precision and actionable insights in job cost reports.

## Key Achievements
- Enhanced reporting accuracy through automation, reducing the risk of human error.
- Improved the efficiency of budget forecasting processes by optimizing workflows.
- Delivered scalable and reusable reporting templates adaptable to different projects.

## Usage
